# Unity-Synth-Experiments

A set of simple generative sound engines using OnAudioFilterRead() in Unity. I borrowed pretty heavily from https://github.com/JZito/Unity-Synthesizer-in-C-Sharp to get started, but ultimately reorganized things so each engine is pretty self contained.

## pxFemme
A kind of fun 2-op FM design with feedback on both the modulator and the carrier. Makes some good growly sounds

##pxSnarple
Simple loopy sample player/synth loosely inspired by the Volca Sample in loop mode

##pxStrax
2-osc subtractive square+triangle synth design with a Moog-style VCF and waveshaping distortion
